# About the Project

hAIre is a platform designed to empower job seekers by revolutionizing the way they discover opportunities that align with their unique qualifications and experiences. Simultaneously, hAIre provides support to organizations and companies in making precise assessments of candidate's suitability for the ideal job roles. By utilizing the power of AI, particularly neural networks, hAIre has the capability to predict with high accuracy (hopefully) whether a candidate is an ideal fit for a particular position. In today’s fiercely competitive job market, job seekers frequently fight for finding a great opportunity, while companies often face the challenge of finding the perfect/ideal candidate. Our team (CH2-PS016) is dedicated to create a new breakthrough that eases their worry about whether to find a job or choose the right talent.
